# Plan and Strategy
This whole experience felt like a big adventure full of late nights, questions, research, mistakes, and wins. We're really thankful for such a lovely opportunity!
## Principles
- **Be accurate**
- **Be creative**
- **Google your smartest teammate :)**
- **Ask everyone**
- **Be Brave and Open to try**

  ## Ideas
- We excluded the ultrasonic sensor because it takes a long time to respond, making it relatively slow and less accurate. Additionally, when turning at a 90-degree angle, it may return incorrect values, as it reports the nearest distance rather than the parallel one.
- We did not use the color sensor because its readings change with varying lighting conditions, and it needs to be very close to the object to provide accurate values.
- We opted for sensors that rely on laser light transmission technology because they offer relatively higher accuracy,and they provide an approximate measurement of the distance between the robot and the opposing objects in an almost parallel alignment.
- Speed is important, but what matters more is accomplishing the required task with high accuracy first, and then increasing the speed.
- Mechanical calibration is indeed very important; ensuring minimal deviation from a straight path is essential.
- All sensors collect data to accurately determine the robot's position; the key to the solution always lies in measuring distances and pinpointing the robot's location.
- A strong framework is incredibly valuable, it significantly simplifies the process of tackling challenges.

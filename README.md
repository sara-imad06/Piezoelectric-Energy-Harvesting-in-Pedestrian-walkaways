# Project Idea
The idea of this project is to convert mechanical energy generated by movement in crowded areas, such as pedestrian footsteps and vehicle motion, into electrical energy.
This electrical energy is then utilized for lighting applications, including street lighting and pathway illumination, aiming to improve energy efficiency and make better use of wasted kinetic energy.

# Implemented Circuit Concept
In the implemented circuit, mechanical energy generated by human movement is captured using a piezoelectric sensor, which converts this mechanical energy into electrical energy.
The generated electrical energy is then stored in a capacitor and used to power an LED for lighting purposes.
This implementation demonstrates the practical feasibility of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy and utilizing it for low-power lighting applications.

# What is next ?
In the future, this concept can be expanded by deploying energy harvesting systems in high traffic areas, such as sidewalks, entrances, parking areas, and roads.
Energy generated from pedestrian footsteps and vehicle movement can be stored using advanced energy storage systems and used to power streetlights, pathway lighting, or smart lighting infrastructure, contributing to sustainable and energy-efficient urban solutions.

DC Motor via L298N Module
(Connected to pins 3, 4, and 5)
L298N to Arduino Mega:
•	IN1 → Pin 4 (controls motor direction)
•	IN2 → Pin 5 (controls motor direction)
•	ENA → Pin 3 (PWM pin, controls motor speed)
L298N Power:
•	OUT1 & OUT2 → Connect to DC motor wires
•	12V / VCC → Connect to external power supply (6V–12V battery)
•	GND → Connect to Arduino GND
•	5V (if jumper is present) → Optional; powers logic (you can use it if your battery is strong enough)

 Servo Motor (Steering)
(Connected to pin 9)
 Servo Motor to Arduino Mega:
•	Signal (usually orange or yellow) → Pin 9
•	VCC (red) → External 5V–6V power source
•	GND (brown/black) → Connect to common GND with Arduino
 Servo motors need a separate power supply if they draw significant current. Always connect the grounds together (Arduino GND and power source GND).
